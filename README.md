# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The client Bobby expressed concern of an incoming "silver tsunami"; a large amount of his employees retiring at the same time could be bad for business.
The analysis examined the employees nearing retirement and what departments these employees worked in.
Additionally, the analysis examined employees eligible for mentoring new employees.
This data will be crucial for Bobby's ability to handle the "silver tsunami" and adjust his hiring practices to combat it.

## Results

From the picture below we can see the employees nearing retirements totals by job title.

* The main group of employees retiring are "Senior Engineers"
* In both senior and non-senior groups, engineers are more eligible to retire than "staff"
* There are 1549 employees eligible for mentorship
* There are roughly 70,000 employees nearing retirement

## Summary

With over 70,000 employees nearing retirement the company will have to begin hiring many employees, mostly engineers.
I created a pivot table of the data of employees eligible for mentorship.

In this pivot table we can see only 256 senior engineers are available to mentor new employees. Additionally, 435 engineers and 57 assistant engineers are eligible to mentor.
With 60,000 engineers nearing retirement the current 748 engineers able to mentor may not be just enough to handle the amount of hiring needed to be done to combat the "silver tsunami".
